# Arrays
#### Used to store a collection of things like items in a shopping cart or a list of student scores.

``` 
var scores = [60, 75, 80, 92, 77, 99, 83, 71, 68, 88];
```

> Arrays are accessed by index. the index number starts with 0. 
> For example to access 2nd element, use
```
    var secondElement = scores[1];
```

> To find the number of items in an array, use
```
var length = scores.length;
```

> To loop through the items in an array and print to console.
```
for (var i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
    console.log(scores[i]);
}
```
